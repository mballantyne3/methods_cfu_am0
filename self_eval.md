# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  Admittedly I'm not feeling enormously confident at this time. I could definitely benefit from further study and practice.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  I'm definitely getting there. Simple methods feel fine, complex methods are taxing.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  To be honest I'm just processing. Am I able to use a variety of data types in one method? I just need more practice to be honest.
